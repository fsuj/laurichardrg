# Introduction

Rock glaciers are distinctive morphological features of high mountain periglacial environments. Their deformation processes are strongly linked to permafrost degradation [@haeberli_mountain_2010]. Thus, research of deformation velocities of rock glaciers does not only provide insights into periglacial morphology but also in time evolution of permafrost. Several authors have used rock glaciers as proxies for permafrost presence/absence in permafrost distribution models [@boeckli_statistical_2012,@marcer_permafrost_2017].

In recent years, multi-method approaches have been used in this field of research; @buchli_kinematic_2018 combine laser scanning, terrestrial radar and in-situ measurements at the Furggwanghorn rock glacier in Switzerland. Remote sensing data, especially radar interferometry [@barboux_mapping_2015], optical imagery and laser scanning [@arenson_detection_2016] have become more and more common for rock glacier deformation analysis.

# Study Area

The Laurichard rock glacier is situated in the French Alps, with an approximately 800m long and 100-200m wide tounge flowing from south to north-east. Due to its morphological features it can be considered an active rock glacier [@bodin_multi-annual_2018]. Especially, hillshades generated from available digital elevation models (DEMs) exhibit scarps, oriented perpendicular to the flow direction as well as a steep rising frontal lobe.

Since the beginning of the 1980s, the Laurichard rock glacier has been subject to in-situ and remote sensing photogrammetry research. Refer to @bodin_multi-annual_2018 for the most current research work as well as for an overview over the history of site studies.
