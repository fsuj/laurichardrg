# Introduction

Rock glaciers are distinctive morphological features of high mountain periglacial environments. Their deformation processes are strongly linked to permafrost degradation [@haeberli_mountain_2010]. Thus, research of deformation velocities of rock glaciers does not only provide insights into periglacial morphology but also in time evolution of permafrost. Several authors have used rock glaciers as proxies for permafrost presence/absence in permafrost distribution models [@boeckli_statistical_2012,@marcer_permafrost_2017].

In recent years, multi-method approaches have been used in this field of research; @buchli_kinematic_2018 combine laser scanning, terrestrial radar and in-situ measurements at the Furggwanghorn rock glacier in Switzerland. Remote sensing data, especially radar interferometry (InSAR) [@barboux_mapping_2015], optical imagery and laser scanning [@arenson_detection_2016] have become more and more common for rock glacier deformation analysis. With unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-resolution consumer grade digital cameras and smartphones being more and more widespread, surveys with high to very high resolution in time and space dimensions [@dallasta_unmanned_2017] become affordable in research and natural hazard mitigation contexts. Structure-from-motion (SfM) [@smith_structure_2016] and other established photogrammetric techniques allow for the generation of genuine 3D point clouds as well as 2.5D digital surface models (DSMs) and derivates, acquired by abovementioned techniques [@eltner_imagebased_2016].

From a series of those surface models at different points in time, displacement velocities of mass movement processes as well as surface changes resulting from erosion and denudation can be quantified. Techniques range from simple DEM differencing to 3-dimensional point-cloud comparison [@james_3d_2017].

Image matching techniques are well established methods for the quantification of surface changes in geomorphology and glaciology [@paul_glaciers_2015]. They have already been developed for glacier velocity analyses in the mid-1980s [@scambos_application_1992] and have been developed further since then. They do not necessarily depend on elevation models, except for the quantification of 3-dimensional (i.e. elevation) differences. All image matching algorithms are based on the comparison of either local image patterns or structures/features, on global image characteristics or a combination thereof. They can be applied to panchromatic or colour images as well as to DEMs and their derivates and image transformations (most commonly used: Fourier transformations, filters and principal component analyses) [@heid_evaluation_2012,@dallasta_unmanned_2017]. Besides scope and input data, image matching algorithms can be structured by their similarity measure: The calculation of a normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCC) on two image parts is the most widespread measure [@scambos_application_1992]. More recently, NCC-based similarity measures have been developed further, being based on image derivatives [@heid_evaluation_2012] or on global energy functions [@argandacarreras_consistent_2006].

Image matching techniques have been applied to rock glacier deformation detection and the calculation of velocity fields. @bodin_multi-annual_2018 present one of the most recent examples for the Laurichard rock glacier in the French Alps. Based on their work, we compared the performance of two image matching algorithms for surface displacement detection between 2012 and 2017: 
1. The well-established IMCORR algorithm [@nsidc_imcorr_2018], based on @scambos_application_1992; and 
2. bUnwarpJ, a semi-global algorithm originally developed for image registration in health studies [@argandacarreras_consistent_2006].
For both algorithms we calculated an annual displacement rate of the Laurichard rock glacier, based on high-resolution DEMs from an aerial laser scanning (ALS) campaign in 2012 and from a UAV campaign in 2017. We optimized parameter settings of both approaches and estimated the accuracy of the resulting deformation fields with GPS displacement data from @bodin_multi-annual_2018 and manually mapped surface displacements.


# Study Area

The Laurichard rock glacier is situated in the French Alps, with an approximately 800m long and 100-200m wide tounge flowing from south to north-east. Due to its morphological features it can be considered an active rock glacier [@bodin_multi-annual_2018]. Especially, hillshades generated from available digital elevation models (DEMs) exhibit scarps, oriented perpendicular to the flow direction as well as a steep rising frontal lobe.

Since the beginning of the 1980s, the Laurichard rock glacier has been subject to in-situ and remote sensing photogrammetry research. Refer to @bodin_multi-annual_2018 for the most current research work as well as for an overview over the history of site studies.

# Data and Methods

## Used Data and Preprocessing

To compare the rock glacier's annual displacement rates we used one DEM, acquired by an ALS survey on 16./17. August 2012 with a vertical accuracy of 0.02m and co-registered to a TLS-based DEM from 2005 [@bodin_multi-annual_2018]. The second DEM is derived from a UAV survey in 2017 and processed by Structure-from-Motion techniques (Jason Goetz, personal communication). Both models have been georeferenced and resampled to a 0.1m resolution, but have not been co-registered (JG, personal communication). A first inspection with simple DEM differencing (DoD) showed good accordance between the two data sets in supposedly stable areas around the Laurichard rock glacier. Therefore, we decided to omit a co-registration procedure.

From the DEMs we derived common derivatse: Slope, Aspect and Hillshade with GIS standard settings as well as a principle component analysis of DEM, Hillshade, Aspect and Slope in order to compare algorithm performance based on different input data. We created a rock glacier contour to mask the Laurichard rock glacier from surrounding stable areas.

As validation data we used 3-dimensional annual displacement rates from 2012-2015, derived from a long-term survey (since 1992) of total station and DGPS measurements of TODO: n (18) marked blocks [@bodin_multi-annual_2018]. Additionally, we manually mapped TODO: n identifiable features from the 2012 and 2017 hillshades of the research area, from (TODO: stimmt das? eigentlich: alles maskiert, oder?) supposedly stable areas as well as from the rock glacier itself, with the landmark function of the BUnwarpJ plugin in ImageJ/Fiji (see the following section).

<!-- TODO: brauchen wir das echt?? Expert Based Validation Dataset (Points from ImageJ (Source, Target), Calculate euclidian Distanz -> Calculate XYZ Displacment (Extract Height from Source Image at Source Point, Target Image at Target Point, Make difference (TargetHeight- SourceHeight, Calcilate XYZ with sqrt((XY_Displacement)^2 +(Z_Displacement)^2))) ) -->

## BUnwarpJ plugin for ImageJ

ImageJ [@rueden_imagej2_2017] and its package bundle Fiji [@schindelin_fiji_2012] have been developed for biological and medical image analysis. The plugin BUnwarpJ [@argandacarreras_consistent_2006] performs "2D image registration based on elastic deformation" [@argandacarreras_bunwarpj_2017] between two images. The image registration algorithm calculates a deformation matrix represented by cubic B-splines from an optimization of global (energy functions describing the dissimilarity of two images) and local (user-identified feature tracking) image characteristics. Terms in the optimization equation system are weighted; thus, the importance of global and local image characteristics can be weighted by the user [@argandacarreras_consistent_2006].

In the intended use of BUnwarpJ, the resulting deformation field is used for co-registering images with one reference image. While this application can also be employed in remote sensing applications, we considered the resulting B-spline deformation field as the displacement velocity information. To the authors' knowledge, BUnwrapJ in ImageJ distributions has hardly been used yet in geomorphological applications (JG, personal communication).

We manually set 61 landmarks in the compared images in order to identify features of local deformations on the rock glacier surface as well as in stable areas. In order to analyse the sensitivity of the BUnwarpJ optimization algorithm, we varied
1. the weights of global and local (landmarks) image characteristics, ranging in a scale from 4:0 to 0:4; 
2. the landmark input set by excluding one one boulder with an extraordinarily high movement rate at the rock glacier front lobe (61 vs. 61 landmarks as input data) and landmarks indicating rock fall from a wall; and
3. input images (DEM, HILL, ASPECT, SLOPE, PCA1).

The areal transformation output resulting from varying input data and BUnwarpJ settings could be used for the calculation of 3-dimensional displacement, based on the 2012 DEM.

We used the versions Fiji ImageJ 1.52d and BUnwarpJ 2.6 as well as R version 3.4.4 [@base] and R Studio Version 1.1.453 TODO: cite! for our analysis.

## IMCORR

Image correlation algorithms are well-established methods in image matching and feature tracking, originally developed for glacier velocity analyses [@scambos_application_1992]. In general, algorithms compute a normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) as a similarity metric of two bounded image areas: For a reference window (also called chip) of image 1 the NCC between image 1 and image 2 is calculated within a search window (chip) of image 2. The maximum CC within this search window is considered the tracked feature; the distance between the center of the reference window in image 1 and the center of the highest correlation results in a deformation vector [@debella-gilo_sub-pixel_2011]. Correlation metrics as well as input data have been developed further in recent years: Energy functions and derivatives of images in the spatial domain, enhancing transistions between features, as well as Fourier transformations in the frequency domain are used in common implementations of correlation algorithms; in the frequency domain, phase correlation coefficients are commonly used as approximations of normalized correlation coefficients [@heid_evaluation_2012].

We used an algorithm performing a matching on Fourier transformed input images on user-selected reference and search window sizes (16 to 128 and 16 to 256 pixels, respectively) [@nsidc_imcorr_2018]. From @bodin_multi-annual_2018 we assumed an average displacement of around 2m per year; by reasoning, we compared only search window sizes of 12.8 (reference window size 6.4m) and 25.6m (reference window size of 6.4m and 12.8m) for 3-dimensional displacements with the DEMs as input images and according height information. Due to computational reasons, we omitted a comparison of different input data sets.

We extracted the start points of the resulting displacement vector field and interpolated the point data to areal data (inverse distance weighting with a local search distance of 10m and Gaussian weighting with 10m bandwidth) according to @bodin_multi-annual_2018.

We used the IMCORR -- Feature Tracking and Inverse Distance Weighted tools implemented in SAGA GIS version 2.3.1 [@conrad_system_2015] for our analysis.

## Algorithm Comparison

We masked the resulting (data)interpolated) deformation velocity fields as well the two validation data sets, excluding stable areas, a steep rock wall and obviously striped data in the 2012 DEM from the validation procedure. We compared the resulting deformation fields to the deformations measured by @bodin_multi-annual_2018 on 18 marked blocks with GPS measurements and to the manually mapped deformations between identifiable features of the 2012 and 2017 hillshades. We used R² as measure of TODO Übereinstimmung and RMSE as error measure; both are dependent on the mean as 1st moment and therefore prone to outliers. Because the validation data sets comprised only limited numbers of points, we also analyzed performance metrics based on the median (quartile ranges).

We analyzed the influence of extreme deformation/velocity values on BUnwarpJ by comparing two landmark sets (61 vs. 60, excluding one block at the front lobe) with the validation data sets. We used only the better performing landmark for the comparison of different image data and a shift in weights from local to global optimization algorithm terms. For IMCORR, we analyzed the importance of  search and reference chip sizes and therefore of assumptions prior to the algorithm application.

We chose only the best performing resulting deformation fields of each algorithm for a comparison of BUnwarpJ and IMCORR. We analyzed performance metrics as well as th visual outcome and accordance with the results of @bodin_multi-annual_2018.

# Discussion


* assumptions and prerequisites

* discuss validation data and data sets
* interpolated areal data vs. point datad (COSP!)

* Test I
  + In both cases 60 Landmarks are showing the better values - >
  + Explenation for R² of 0.0499
    + Valdidation points ( 3 to 4) of bodin are located in the Area of extreme Displacement (see fig. 1) -> our statistic colappses
    + better R² for expert based Validaiton points, no point is located in the Area of extreme Displacement, but this is also showing a low R²
  + Explenation for different RMSE
    + Different number of samling Points
    + Relativelly high RMSE for Bodin 60 Points ( in comparison to expert based)
  + Conlusion
    + 18 Sampling points are increasing the RMSE, Use at least a min. of 30 (or more?!)
    + R² is not directly influenced by the numer of samling points
    + Take care while collection Sampling Points ( valdidation)
      + do not collect Sampling points on extremely moving (falling) rocks
    + 61 Sampling points shows a high sensitivity to processes at the top (falling rocks)
    
    
* Test II
  + In both cases the DEM as Transformation input is the right choice, but at leat i thing it doesn't matter if we use DEM, Hill or PC1
    + Aspect and Slope (can change easielly, at least there is not usefull information)
    + DEM, Hillshade, PC1 within a 10% span, is it really significant?!
  + Looking at the RMSE confirms the guess of Test I
  + Conclusion
    + Use the DEM as Input for the Transformation, with 60 LM (see test I)
    + RMSE still higher for less Validation Points
    + One Option could be to Calulate a PCA with the DEM and Hillshade ( both are showing strong correlation -> maybe we can get a higher R² and lower RMSE if we extract the Main Information from both Images)
    
* Test III
  + The best result is achieved with 1_1
  + Explenation for weighting 2 is better than 4
    + with the Weighting Factor of 4 the weight is overweighted?!
  + Explenation that LMW showing better Results than IMW
    + a bad Algorithem to for image comaprison (IMCOOR is showing better Results with just Image Comparing Test IV)
    + Convertion of Inputdata to 8 bit for ImageJ/Bunwarp -> loss of Data (especilly DEM originally 32 bit), is shout work with 32-bit data, but it didn't (BUG?!)

* Test IV
  + Best Result 256_64
    + Explenation ?! Smaller window size in Window?! Getting better the differeces?!

* Final Results
  + Discussion of Flow direction (?!)
  + Plausibility of Results
    + relativelly stable areas in BunwarpJ at the Front of the Tounge (real?!)
    + unstable areas in Imcorr at the same possition (more real?!)
    + Different Displacement zones (how does a rock glazier move-> wich one is more realistic?)
  + Scatterplot?!
    + What we can dicuss here?!
  + Image Statistics
    + Influenced image Statistic of IMCORR (lower right corner)
    + IMCORR interpolation of Lines to Points to Image
  + Visual comparison to Bodin et al. 2017 ?! -> recognize that bodin is 2m Resolution

# Conclusion

* Handling of Algorithms
  + IMCORR
    + High Processing Time with IMCORR, Interpolation (global, focal), no smooth Results (Bodin et al. Upsamling 2m)
    + Good Results (values), Visual not nice looking
  + BunwrapJ
    + "Resampling" to 8-bit as input image for ImageJ -> loss of information
    + ca. 20 min Transformation calculation (each test)
    + Use of R Script -> Process of Transformation (5-10 min each)
    + all in all high processing speed, good Results (Values as well as Image visuell)
* Both Algorithms suitable
* Future Research
  + Test Derivates with IMCORR
  + Test everything with COSI-Corr
