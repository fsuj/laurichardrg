@article{Bodin.2018,
 abstract = {Rock glaciers result from the long-term creeping of ice-rich permafrost along mountain slopes. Under warming conditions, deformation is expected to increase, and potential destabilization of those landforms may lead to hazardous phenomena. Monitoring the kinematics of rock glaciers at fine spatial resolution is required to better understand at which rate, where and how they deform. We present here the results of several years of in situ surveys carried out between 2005 and 2015 on the Laurichard rock glacier, an active rock glacier located in the French Alps. Repeated terrestrial laser-scanning (TLS) together with aerial laser-scanning (ALS) and structure-from-motion-multi-view-stereophotogrammetry (SFM-MVS) were used to accurately quantify surface displacement of the Laurichard rock glacier at interannual and pluri-annual scales. Six very high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs, pixel size {\textless}50 cm) of the rock glacier surface were generated, and their respective quality was assessed. The relative horizontal position accuracy (XY) of the individual DEMs is in general less than 2 cm with a co-registration error on stable areas ranging from 20--50 cm. The vertical accuracy is around 20 cm. The direction and amplitude of surface displacements computed between DEMs are very consistent with independent geodetic field measurements (e.g., DGPS). Using these datasets, local patterns of the Laurichard rock glacier kinematics were quantified, pointing out specific internal (rheological) and external (bed topography) controls. The evolution of the surface velocity shows few changes on the rock glacier's snout for the first years of the observed period, followed by a major acceleration between 2012 and 2015 affecting the upper part of the tongue and the snout.},

@article{DallAsta.2017,
 abstract = {Among other techniques, aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry have long been used to control the displacements of landslides and glaciers as well as for the detection of terrain morphological changes. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are today an efficient tool to perform data acquisition in rough or difficult terrain, both safely and quickly, avoiding hazards and risks for the operators while at the same time containing the survey costs. Since 2012 ARPAVdA (the Regional Environmental Protection Agency of Aosta Valley, Italy) periodically surveys with UAS photogrammetry the Gran Sometta rock glacier, the Agency main monitoring site for the climate change impacts on high-mountain areas and related infrastructures.

A Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophoto of the rock glacier are produced after each survey flight. In order to accurately georeference them in a stable reference system, a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) campaign is carried out at each epoch, to update the coordinates of signalised Ground Control Points (GCPs), since they partly lay in unstable (moving) areas. In late August 2015 a survey flight has been executed with a senseFly eBee RTK, with differential corrections sent from a ground reference station. The block has been adjusted without GCP using, as control information, only the projection centres coordinates encoded in the images. The RMS of the differences found on twelve Check Points were about 4 cm in horizontal and 7 cm in elevation, i.e. practically the same accuracy found using GCP. Differences between the DSMs produced at the same epoch with block orientation performed with GCP and with GNSS-determined projection centres were also investigated.

To evaluate the rock glacier displacement fields between two epochs, corresponding features were at first manually identified on the orthophotos by a trained operator. To avoid the manual time-consuming procedure and increase the density of displacement information, two automatic procedures, the former using Least Squares Matching (LSM) and the latter a proprietary implementation of Semi-Global Matching (SGM) have been implemented. Both techniques were applied to pairs of orthophotos as well as to pairs of DSMs at different epochs. A discussion of the characteristics of the implemented methods is provided and the results of the comparison of the two methods with manual measurements are illustrated. Overall, results using DSM matching provided higher completeness of the displacement field than orthophoto matching, especially if long-term (year-to-year) comparisons are considered. At the same time, SGM in both cases produced less mismatches and more smooth and reliable displacement fields than LSM.},

@article{DebellaGilo.2011,
 abstract = {This study evaluates the performance of two fundamentally different approaches to achieve sub-pixel precision of normalised cross-correlation when measuring surface displacements on mass movements from repeat optical images. In the first approach, image intensities are interpolated to a desired sub-pixel resolution using a bi-cubic interpolation scheme prior to the actual displacement matching. In the second approach, the image pairs are correlated at the original image resolution and the peaks of the correlation coefficient surface are then located at the desired sub-pixel resolution using three techniques, namely bi-cubic interpolation, parabola fitting and Gaussian fitting. Both principal approaches are applied to three typical mass movement types: rockglacier creep, glacier flow and land sliding. In addition, the influence of pixel resolution on the accuracies of displacement measurement using image matching is evaluated using repeat images resampled to different spatial resolutions. Our results show that bi-cubic interpolation of image intensity performs best followed by bi-cubic interpolation of the correlation surface. Both Gaussian and parabolic peak locating turn out less accurate. By increasing the spatial resolution (i.e. reducing the ground pixel size) of the matched images by 2 to 16 times using intensity interpolation, 40{\%} to 80{\%} reduction in mean error in reference to the same resolution original image could be achieved. The study also quantifies how the mean error, the random error, the proportion of mismatches and the proportion of undetected movements increase with increasing pixel size (i.e. decreasing spatial resolution) for all of the three mass movement examples investigated.},

@article{Ghuffar.2013,
 abstract = {An active landslide in Doren, Austria, has been studied by multitemporal airborne and terrestrial laser scanning from 2003 to 2012. To evaluate the changes, we have determined the 3D motion using the range flow algorithm, an established method in computer vision, but not yet used for studying landslides. The generated digital terrain models are the input for motion estimation; the range flow algorithm has been combined with the coarse-to-fine resolution concept and robust adjustment to be able to determine the various motions over the landslide. The algorithm yields fully automatic dense 3D motion vectors for the whole time series of the available data. We present reliability measures for determining the accuracy of the estimated motion vectors, based on the standard deviation of components. The differential motion pattern is mapped by the algorithm: parts of the landslide show displacements up to 10 m, whereas some parts do not change for several years. The results have also been compared to pointwise reference data acquired by independent geodetic measurements; reference data are in good agreement in most of the cases with the results of range flow algorithm; only some special points (e.g., reflectors fixed on trees) show considerably differing motions.},

@article{Heid.2012,
 abstract = {Automatic matching of images from two different times is a method that is often used to derive glacier surface velocity. Nearly global repeat coverage of the Earth's surface by optical satellite sensors now opens the possibility for global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier flow with a number of applications in, for example, glacier physics, glacier-related climate change and impact assessment, and glacier hazard management. The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate different existing image matching methods for glacier flow determination over large scales. The study compares six different matching methods: normalized cross-correlation (NCC), the phase correlation algorithm used in the COSI-Corr software, and four other Fourier methods with different normalizations. We compare the methods over five regions of the world with different representative glacier characteristics: Karakoram, the European Alps, Alaska, Pine Island (Antarctica) and southwest Greenland. Landsat images are chosen for matching because they expand back to 1972, they cover large areas, and at the same time their spatial resolution is as good as 15 m for images after 1999 (ETM+pan). Cross-correlation on orientation images (CCF-O) outperforms the three similar Fourier methods, both in areas with high and low visual contrast. NCC experiences problems in areas with low visual contrast, areas with thin clouds or changing snow conditions between the images. CCF-O has problems on narrow outlet glaciers where small window sizes (about 16 pixels by 16 pixels or smaller) are needed, and it also obtains fewer correct matches than COSI-Corr in areas with low visual contrast. COSI-Corr has problems on narrow outlet glaciers and it obtains fewer correct matches compared to CCF-O when thin clouds cover the surface, or if one of the images contains snow dunes. In total, we consider CCF-O and COSI-Corr to be the two most robust matching methods for global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier velocities. If combining CCF-O with locally adaptive template sizes and by filtering the matching results automatically by comparing the displacement matrix to its low pass filtered version, the matching process can be automated to a large degree. This allows the derivation of glacier velocities with minimal (but not without!) user interaction and hence also opens up the possibility of global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier flow.},

Global Land Ice Measurements from Space - Satellite Multispectral Imaging of Glaciers (GLIMS book for short) is the leading state-of-the-art technical and interpretive presentation of satellite image data and analysis of the changing state of the world's glaciers. The book is the most definitive, comprehensive product of a global glacier remote sensing consortium, Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS, http://www.glims.org).~With 33 chapters and a companion e-supplement, the world's foremost experts in satellite image analysis of glaciers analyze the current state and recent and possible future changes of glaciers across the globe and interpret these findings for policy planners. Climate change is with us for some time to come, and its impacts are being felt by the world's population. The GLIMS Book, to be released about the same time as the IPCC's~ 5th Assessment report on~global climate warming, buttresses and adds rich details and~authority to the global change community's understanding of climate change impacts on the cryosphere. ~This~will be a definitive and technically complete reference for experts and students examining the responses of glaciers to climate change. World~experts demonstrate that~glaciers are changing in response to the ongoing climatic upheaval~in addition to other~factors that pertain to the circumstances of individual glaciers. The global~mosaic of~glacier changes is documented by quantitative analyses and are placed into a perspective of causative factors. Starting with a Foreword, Preface, and Introduction, the~GLIMS book gives the rationale for and history of glacier~monitoring and satellite data analysis.~It includes a comprehensive set of six {\textquotedbl}how-to{\textquotedbl}~methodology chapters, twenty-five chapters~detailing regional glacier state and dynamical changes, and~an in-depth summary and~interpretation chapter placing the~observed glacier changes into a global~context of the~coupled atmosphere-land-ocean system.

@article{Paul.2015,
 abstract = {Glaciers and their changes through time are increasingly obtained from a wide range of satellite sensors. Due to the often remote location ofglaciers in inaccessible and high-mountain terrain, satellite observations frequently provide the only available measurements. Furthermore, satellite data provide observations of glacier characteristics that are difficult to monitor using ground-based measurements, thus complementing the latter. In the Glaciers{\_}cci project ofthe European Space Agency (ESA), three of these characteristics are investigated in detail: glacier area, elevation change and surface velocity.We use (a) data fromoptical sensors to derive glacier outlines, (b) digital elevation models from at least two points in time, (c) repeat altimetry for determining elevation changes, and (d) data from repeat optical and microwave sensors for calculating surface velocity. For the latter, the two sensor types provide complementary information in terms of spatio-temporal coverage. While (c) and (d) can be generated mostly automatically, (a) and (b) require the intervention of an analyst. Largely based on the results of various round robin experiments (multi-analyst benchmark studies) for each of the products, we suggest and describe the most suitable algorithms for product creation and provide recommendations concerning their practical implementation and the required post-processing. For some of the products (area, velocity) post-processing can influence product quality more than the main-processing algorithm.},

 abstract = {The worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers has important consequences for the water, food, and power supply of large and densely populated areas in South and Central Asia. Successful mitigation of the hydrological impacts on societies as well as assessing glacier-related hazards require large-scale monitoring of glacier dynamics. However, detailed glaciological data from the Asian highlands are lacking, due to its size and difficult accessibility. We have applied a novel technique for precise orthorectification, co-registration, and sub-pixel correlation of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery to derive surface velocities of Himalayan glaciers. Our approach allows for the correction of offsets due to attitude effects and sensor distortions, as well as elevation errors if a digital elevation model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was used for orthorectification. After postprocessing, the error on the displacements is on the order of 2--4 m per correlation. Translated into annual velocities, this error is reduced (increased) when the correlated images are more (less) than a year apart. Through application of a filtering procedure and several quality tests, the consistency of the results is validated to provide confidence in the remotely sensed velocity measurements, despite the lack of ground control. This novel approach allows fast, easy, and economically viable acquisition of detailed glaciological data in areas of difficult access and provides a means for large-scale monitoring of glaciers in high mountainous terrain.},
